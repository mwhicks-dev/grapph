# grapph

C++ graph encoding library. Feel free to put feature requests or bug reports you find into Issues. I will definitely fix the bugs, and will implement features as I see fit.

## build instructions

Testing done via CMake; to build, just use Makefile. Only `build-essential` required to build on Linux.

For Linux build, use Makefile build targets: `make clean lib`.

Compiled library will be in `bin/`. You should be able to use this like any other library.
